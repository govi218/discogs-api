# Discogs SDK

A library for interacting with Discogs data for your app!

## Sample usage
- Create an application on Discogs through their [developer portal](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)
- Obtain the `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret` from your application
- Create a dotenv file in this project's root and add these vars:
```
CONSUMER_KEY = '<Your key>'
CONSUMER_SECRET = '<Your secret>'
```
- Install the dependencies with your favorite package manager, e.g. `npm install`
- Run the app to go through the OAuth flow and see your Discogs identity: `node index.js`

### NPM module coming soon!
